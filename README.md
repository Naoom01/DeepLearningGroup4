This Github repository consists of the models and the code used for the project of the Deep Learning course. 
The trained models are stored as .p files and can be found in its according folder. This allows for immediatley loading in the already trained model without
having to go through the entire model training proces again. 
Finally, the code can be found in DL_Models.ipynb. Note that before running this notebook, the paths should be changed according to your personal path structure. Furthermore, 
this particular notebook was used in Google Collab for the benefits of a free GPU. Therefore the file mounted to a drive path. If running the code locally, you can ignore the cell where
the path is mounted to your drive and replace base_dir with a regular path. 

The data and the models in h5 format are too big to be stored on Github, therefore they will be handed in via a different link.
